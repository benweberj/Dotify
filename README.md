# **Dotify** | Ben Weber
This is the beginning of an Android music player app, written in Kotlin. There is no song-playing functionality, but the buttons still respond to taps.

## Extra Credit
1. A user can't enter a blank username. When they do, a random username is suggested.
2. _NA_
3. Created a barrier to separate album cover from above elements (profile pic, username, and 'change user' button).
4. Didn't use any dimensions, but all colors and strings are referenced from `values/colors.xml` and `values/strings.xml` respectively.
5. Yep, did this with `app:layout_constraintDimensionRatio="1:1"`.
6. _NA_
