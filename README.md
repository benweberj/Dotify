# **Dotify** v2 | Ben Weber
This is the beginning of an Android music player app, written in Kotlin. You can shuffle, delete, and preview songs, but there is no music-playing functionality yet.

## Extra Credit
1. Back arrow on song player screen brings you back to song select.
2. Long-pressing song deletes it and toasts a confirmation.
3. Shuffling library is animated.
